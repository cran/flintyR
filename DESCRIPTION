Description: Given a multivariate dataset and some knowledge about the dependencies between its features, it is important to ensure the observations or individuals are exchangeable before fitting a model to the data in order to make inference from it, or assigning randomized treatments in order to estimate treatment effects. This package provides a flexible non-parametric test of exchangeability, allowing the user to specify the feature dependencies by hand. See Aw, Spence and Song (2021) for the accompanying paper.
